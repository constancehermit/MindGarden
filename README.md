# Mind Garden

> In French, “cultiver son jardin intérieur” means to tend to your internal garden—to take care of your mind. The garden metaphor is particularly apt: taking care of your mind involves cultivating your curiosity (the seeds), growing your knowledge (the trees), and producing new thoughts (the fruits) -- [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden)
