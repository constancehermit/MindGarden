# Privacy Notice

[Drawn to Code](https://drawntocode.com) is a personal website.  
It is a humble repository of thoughts. A small serving of static content.  
Despite it's insignificance, we are told, a privacy policy is obligatory. 

## What information do we collect & why?

**We intentionally collect as little information as possible.** 
In two cases we do process personal information indirectly, though. 

### 1. Usage Data
This is collected automatically when you access our website. A inevitable effect of using the internet!
- **IP address**
- **Browser** type and version
- **Pages** you visit

### 2. Cookies 
To make our website more user friendly, we may use cookies (or similar, like the browser local storage). Examples:
- **Language Preference** 
- **Theme Preference** (e.g. darkmode)

## What information do we share with third parties? 

### Usage Data
We're hosted by [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/), and although we do **not** have analytics enabled, it's standard for hosting companies to collect some usage data.  
You can read their [privacy policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/) and [GDPR notice](https://www.netlify.com/gdpr-ccpa/) for more information.

## That's it?
Yep! If you need the more in-depth version, we have an actual privacy policy [here](policy.md), for legal purposes.
