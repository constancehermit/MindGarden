## Why can't I start this task?

I suffer from a high cognitive load in my project.  
My tasks tend to be vague, and I don't get much, if any, guidance on solving them.  
I feel isolated and overwhelmed a lot of the time, and that is environmental!  

Overwhelm is a classic outcome when you have: 
* High expectations
* Low structure
* Low clarity 
* Little support 

## When is an automation tool harder to pick up?

There is a difference between working with (let's say) Cypress, and an (almost undocumented) in-house tool. 

Someone building with Cypress has: 
* A toolbox filled with tools
* A manual for every step 
* Online forums where thousands of people share their tips
* Tutorial blogs, videos, FAQ pages 

While I have: 
* No blueprints or specs
* Custom tools from a factory no-one documented
* No information on where the other parts are (or if they exist)
* A toolbox that either is missing tools, or very cryptically labelled 
And when I ask where the manual is, "Just figure it out, read the code, other people manage it."  
*Ok so 'figure it out' isn't quite true, I do get offers of help. But.*

## Why "ask if you're stuck" is a cognitive burden

I work with genuinely kind and helpful people, but 'I'm here if you have questions' is super uncomfortable.  

* Cognitive load of framing the question! Even knowing what to ask is hard! 
* What am I supposed to know? Will I seem stupid asking this? Fear of being judged that is legitimate in a system where low performers are analysed by management by asking for opinions from peers.
* What information is relevant here? Over/under-explaining? 
* What's their time budget? Am I interrupting important tasks? Anxiety about wasting time that is, again, legitimate in a very fast-paced project under immense pressure to deliver. 

Basically “just ask!” becomes “lose hours of your life focusing on the wrong thing and then gamble with your self-esteem every time you get stuck.”  

The burden should be on the instructor to make information accessible.  
'Ask if you're stuck' shifts the **entire** cognitive burden onto the learner. 

## How this environment triggers executive dysfunction 

This whole situation is ESPECIALLY difficult if you are neurodivergent. 
Cognitive Load + Task Ambiguity = executive dysfunction trigger! 

I, like many ND folks, need a lot of structure for a happy learning brain to keep going: 

* Clearly defined tasks and scopes
* Predictability, consistency, structure
* Visible understandable systems, traceable causality

Unstructured environments are almost paralysing.  
I end up trying to build my own structure, but that's another task/struggle before I can even START.

"Just automate a test" is super ambiguous.  
Each step contains a whole bunch of other steps that mostly consist of "what does THIS mean?"

* Task Paralysis: where do I even start with this?? 
* Hyperfocus and Avoidance: spending hours on the wrong thing or not at all (this article is a great example)
* Procrastination: not to be confused with laziness, this attempts to reduce massive anxiety
* Executive Fatigue: I have to convert something vague into many useful steps from scratch

It's not just *uncomfortable*, it **disrupts the way my brain is wired to learn**. 
I also don't tend to feel rising stress until it's overwhelming. I suddenly get angry and shut down without understanding how it was building up! 

## How do I cope? 

Lol, badly. With a lot of anxiety and stress and overwhelm and confusion.  
Why can't I do {the thing}?? Why won't my brain work? Why is this SO HARD? 

When I have the capacity to do them, there are things that help: 
* Defining my own high level goal(s)
* And mini-milestones (progress)
* Assigning myself concrete, time-bound, self-contained learning missions
* Learn through visualising (diagrams, sketchnotes, miro boards)
* Document! Create external memory! Especially re-usable snippets
* Learn through teaching (writing for a hypothetical future colleague or 'my past self')
* Finding a buddy or forming a cohort (for accountability and sharing)
* Taking the time to prepare/formulate very specific requests for feedback and input
* Seeking informal mentorship / willing allies to ask for pairing or how-do-you-think sessions

Basically, I have to be the detective and guide and student and manager and teacher all at once.
