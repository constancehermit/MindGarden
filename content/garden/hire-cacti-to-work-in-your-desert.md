# Work In Progress 

## Are we being set up for success?

First intro of some kind re: not thriving & questioning why  
What are the signs of not thriving? Maybe less engagement and motivation? be specific 

<note-quote
    quote="As much as your upbringing might have taught you to look inward when assigning blame for failure, I suggest itâ€™s worth questioning your environment with a critical eye [...] and ask yourself if you are being set up for success."

## What is culture?

Note on culture first (aka the desert environment), defined in one paper like below  
Which is interesting esp. with regard to the tacit part and 'correct' way to perceive problems

<note-quote
    quote="Pattern of shared tacit assumptions that was learned by a group considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think, and feel in relation to those problems"

## Check under your own shoes

Of course, if it smells like shit everywhere you go, maybe check under your own shoes, first.   
But I'm talking specifically to people with a strong inner critic. The self-doubt-ers, chronic not-good-enough-ers (it me).

Some things are universally detrimental, and some places really are toxic, but in most cases, it's likely to be a combination of you + environment. Maybe something here about how people can divorce even when there was no cheating, no abuse, the people just wanted different things. Same re: workplace. 

## The metaphor

<note-quote
    quote="The way it looks in my head is: we plant a rose in a desert, and then wonder why it isn't thriving.  
    My challenge often is worded something like this: 'What have we done to create an environment where the most likely outcome is [that] this person succeeds?'.   
    Have we planted a rose in a desert? Or a swampland? Or a well-tended garden? Or if [we have] a desert and that isn't going to change, we need to hire cacti."

</note-quote>

Then the (best) stage: building up the metaphor in more detail  
Lighting and soil requirements!!  
Emphasis that no plant or region is better/worse (adrenaline explorers on the mountainface? cosy artisans in the cottage garden?) 

## Impact on finding fit 

What can we do to understand (look from different perspectives)

For the individual - how to understand what we need to thrive?  
For the team/lead - how to evaluate what kind of environment we currently have, what we want, who can grow there?  
& both - how to find this out at the interview stage?? (hint: safety is crucial)  (ref. Vernon's Qs on 'what happens if they leave')
