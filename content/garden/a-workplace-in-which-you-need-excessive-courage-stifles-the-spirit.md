## Creating software is a team activity.

It's people working together, with all the mess and complexity that that entails.

Every part of the process involves listening and communicating, and I'm convinved that the trickier problems we grapple with (like building the right thing, or collaborating effectively at scale) hinge on people and communication, rather than technology. To quote Jerry Weinberg: "No matter how it looks at first, it's always a people problem". 

Communicating, collaborating, getting stuck, finding our way again, making mistakes, reflecting, adjusting, learning, together. 

## Making mistakes openly is integral to a team's learning process. 

It's more than just making mistakes though, it's about admitting to them without repercussion. Continually and openly making mistakes and, crucially, feeling safe in doing so. It can take courage to be vulnerable and admit to our own mistakes even in a safe space! 

 <note-quote
    quote="[...] people tend to act in ways that inhibit learning when they face the potential for threat or embarrassment
    [...] those in a position to initiate learning behavior may believe they are placing themselves at risk; for example, by admitting an error or asking for help, an individual may appear incompetent and thus suffer a blow to his or her image. In addition, such individuals may incur more tangible costs if their actions create unfavorable impressions on people who influence decisions about promotions, raises, or project assignments. "

## When we don't feel safe in a team, learning is inhibited.

If our environment feels hostile, unsafe, or exclusionary, our willingness to engage in problem-solving behaviours drops significantly. Here are some examples of learning behaviours that are limited in such an atmosphere:

&#9999; Seeking feedback  
&#9999; Sharing information  
&#9999; Asking for help  
&#9999; Talking about mistakes  
&#9999; Experimentation

## Psychological safety boosts team learning.

Psychological safety is a shared belief that the team is safe for intrapersonal risk-taking. It is about trust, and respect.

    quote="Psychological safety describes the belief that team members  will  respond  positively  when  one  exposes one’s  thoughts, such  as by  asking questions,  seeking feedback, reporting a mistake, or proposing new ideas. It enables team members to bring forth concerns and issues  that  in  turn  provide  the  team  with  valuable information.  It  facilitates  a  climate  of  productive discussion, allowing team members to relax their guard and engage openly in behaviors underlying learning and improvement, which  creates opportunities  to enhance team performance.

<note-quote
    quote="The term is meant to suggest neither a careless sense of permissiveness, nor an unrelentingly positive affect but, rather, a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up. This confidence stems from mutual respect and trust among team members. "

Psychological safety is not about being nice, and not about being the same. It is present in a culture in which people are comfortable being themselves. 

<note-quote
    quote="Team psychological safety is not the same as group cohesiveness, as research has shown that cohesiveness can reduce willingness to disagree and challenge others' views, such as in the phenomenon of groupthink. "

    quote="Psychological Safety is not about being nice. It is not about holding back to comfort your teammates [...] It is quite the opposite; it is about creating an atmosphere in which candor and openness is the default and not the exception."

We're more likely to achieve the best results when:  

&#9829; We work with people we **trust** and **respect**, who inspire and challenge us.  
&#9829; We work within a culture where we feel free and **comfortable to be ourselves**.  
&#9829; We work to support and strengthen psychological safety for **everyone** within our team. 


## Psychological safety is a key success factor for software development teams.

What do we mean by successful outcomes? 

&#10003; Adaption to change  
&#10003; Greater collective understanding  
&#10003; Improved performance  

Do we want a team to detect changes in their environment, identify customer requirements, and gain a collective understanding of their domain? Yes? Engagement with learning behaviours is absolutely critical in reaching this outcome, and engagement drops greatly when there is a lack of psychological safety.


## Cultivating psychological safety
