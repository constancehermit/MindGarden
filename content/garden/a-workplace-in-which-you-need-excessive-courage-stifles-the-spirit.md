## Work In Progress

- What I'm trying to say is that the difficult problems we face are not usually about technology, but about people. 
- "It's always a people problem" (Weinberg)
- We're people, working together - with all the mess and complexity that that entails - to create something, for other people. 
- Communicating, collaborating, getting stuck, finding our way again, reflecting, adjusting, succeeding, making mistakes, learning, together. 
- Making mistakes is integral to learning. Also to creativity, and innovation. 
- But not just making mistakes, but admitting to them without repercussion. Continually and openly making them, experimenting, and feeling safe in doing it. 
- In admitting to mistakes we make ourselves vulnerable. Maybe it takes courage to do it, even in a safe space. 
- How much more difficult this becomes if the environment feels hostile, unsafe, exclusionary. 
- When we don't feel safe, we don't want to take risks, we don't want to make ourselves vulnerable, to suffer. 
- Best results when we work with people we like and respect, who inspire and challenge us
- Becoming a compassionate human is a life-long project, but in the meantime
- [Being compassionate is not being nice](https://compassionatecoding.com/blog/2020/9/21/compassion-is-not-about-being-nice)
- Might incl. making people uncomfortable, speaking up against injustice, bringing attention to difficult subjects. 
- Bad communication can cripple motivation/productivity

 > Psychological Safety is not about being nice. It is not about holding back to comfort your teammates [...] It is quite the opposite; it is about creating an atmosphere in which candor and openness is the default and not the exception.

 > As exciting and rewarding as life as a software engineer can be, coding can be frustrating. We may suffer while troubleshooting mysterious errors, decoding arcane documentation, arguing with coworkers, redoing work because of miscommunication, or dealing with legacy code. And those are just a few examples—the high incidence of burnout, depression, and anxiety in the tech industry indicates that suffering is a rampant issue.
