## Software development teams perform better when they feel safe

In my note about how [a workplace in which you need excessive courage stifles the creative spirit](a-workplace-in-which-you-need-excessive-courage-stifles-the-creative-spirit) I wrote about the impacts of psychological safety (or a lack thereof) on software development teams. 

Because software is *"built by, with, and for human beings"* <a href="#What-does-Compassion-have-to-do-with-Coding">[1]</a>, and psychological safety plays a big part in allowing *"team members to overcome the anxiety and fear of failure that is often necessary for learning"* <a href="#Psychological-Safety-in-Agile-Software-Development-Teams">[4]</a>, we should be wary of behaving in ways that limit the creative potential of the people around us. 

We know that today's *"dynamic and hypercompetitive environments have rendered continuous improvements through learning, change, and innovation imperative to organizational success."* <a href="#Psychological-safety-a-meta-analytic-review-and-extension">[3]</a> and also that *"people tend to act in ways that inhibit learning when they face the potential for threat or embarrassment"* <a href="#Psychological-Safety-and-Learning-Behavior-in-Work-Teams">[2]</a>. 

Information sharing and learning behaviour have a real impact on team performance, so *"psychological safety appears to be an important consideration for organizations attempting to maintain competitiveness."* <a href="#Psychological-safety-a-meta-analytic-review-and-extension">[3]</a>

If we want better outcomes, we should nurture our culture accordingly. 

## Cultivating psychological safety 

*"Psychological safety describes the belief that team members will respond positively when one exposes one’s thoughts, such as by asking questions, seeking feedback, reporting a mistake, or proposing new ideas."* <a href="#Psychological-Safety-in-Agile-Software-Development-Teams">[4]</a>

We're more likely to achieve the best results (and have higher job satisfaction!) when:  

&#9829; We work within a culture where we feel **free to be ourselves**.  
&#9829; We work with people we **trust** and **respect**, who inspire and challenge us.  


## Work in Progress beyond this point c: 

### Personal antecedents

According to meta-analysis research paper: 

Interesting - proactive personalities are less likely than others to perceive a situation as psychologically unsafe. People who are largely unaffected by situational forces and engage consistently anyway! Important to ask what other personalities feel. 

Emotional stability & impact of mental illness on team safety. Again, emotionally stable people are less likely to perceive as unsafe because they're secure. Traumatised people struggle with being anxious/hostile already..

Curious, imaginative, preference for novelty = more likely to feel safe taking risks and being vulnerable in any case.

Learning orientation -> focused on increasing competence and developing new skills = more likely to see making mistakes as necessary and important. THIS ONE in particular can affect things at the team level. 

So if you have these proactive, stable, curious, growth-minded people - they are the ones to start pushing the culture without feeling the negative backlash as much potentially? 


### Work design, context, and leadership

Positive Leadership: inclusive and transformational  
Work design: autonomy and role clarity  
Supportive work context: peer support, org support, trust
