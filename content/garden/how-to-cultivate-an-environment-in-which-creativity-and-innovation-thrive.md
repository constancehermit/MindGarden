## Software development teams perform better when they feel safe



## Cultivating psychological safety 

We're more likely to achieve the best results (and have higher job satisfaction) when:  

&#9829; We work with people we **trust** and **respect**, who inspire and challenge us.  
&#9829; We work within a culture where we feel free and **comfortable to be ourselves**.

So what can we do to cultivate this environment? 

Personal: emotional maturity, learning orientation  
Positive Leadership: inclusive and transformational  
Work design: autonomy and role clarity  
Supportive work context: peer support, org support, trust
