What do I want to communicate here exactly? 
Common struggles & how to nudge your team to work more inclusively?
Also rejecting 'developmental disorder'

[Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.13950v1)
Trying to answer the question "How does the neurodivergent condition of ASD and ADHD individuals affect their work as software engineers in Agile software teams?"

First address their intro about WHAT IS  
& talk about neurodivergent brain existing from birth
(if I can find a paper on this thing)
  Otherwise just talking about how it's not a DISORDER and just a brain

Barriers to inclusion
* Communication difficulties
* Anxiety-inducing environments
* Inadequate training

Recommend inclusive practices:  
* Flexible work modes
* Clear communication

Really specific examples! 
Cognitive & Emotional Dysregulation. 

* Anxiety when breaking down tasks 
* Task initiation through external pressure
* Frustration when flow is disrupted
* Rejection sensitivity in CRs

Interesting specifically re: gaming lobby theory or day huddle:
> Another approach by some people to start tasks was creating external accountability over an open online call “An open call on (Google) Meet. I enter the call, there are four people. So, when someone unmutes and says, ’Hey, can someone help me with this thing here?’ and talk about some problem they had. It’s like, just unmute and talk.” - AS3. “Not only about clarifying technical content, but I’ve also done this with some friends, like calling, staying in Gather Town, Meet, and staying in your own corner, quietly working, sometimes opening a microphone to comment on something, ask a question.” - C4.
