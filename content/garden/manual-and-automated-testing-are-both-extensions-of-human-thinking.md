## If you're comparing, you're missing the point

A computer can check for an expected result, and do so much more often and quickly than a person, but only in the way it's programmed to. [Testing spans many more activities than making assertions.]() All which comes before the pass/fail check, like examining biases and questioning design decisions, is part of a manual, human, process. 

The question of whether manual or automated testing is "better", in a general sense, misses the point. Is it better to cut with scissors or a chainsaw? Tools have different areas of application, and the one you use depends on your context.

[Jeff Nyman reframes the question](http://testerstories.com/2018/11/a-false-dichotomy-of-modern-testing/), asking whether it's better for humans or tools to do the testing, and in doing so highlights the answer: we need both. 

## Tools act as extensions our thinking

We employ tools to extend our capabilities, in fact, [Our Thinking May Not Happen Only In The Brain](our-thinking-may-not-happen-only-in-the-brain)
