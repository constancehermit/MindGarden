Intro into why I'm doing ISTQB, what I expect, biases, being open to learning from every source.. 

## Unstructured thoughts 

### Intro
On day one already hearing mention of shifting left and testing before any code is available - great!   
YES to: 'Is the Quality good?' -> 'you tell me! What does quality mean to YOU? I can measure that'  
Interesting - laywer (and advocate) for user desires/rights?  
Testing the implied requirements  - yes  
ISTQB only defines 9 quality aspects (compare to TestSphere) - surprising  (edit: there are sub-categories, nevermind)

### What is testing
Activities to detect defects and evaluate quality - yes  
Only finished software (dynamic) - much too late - yes    
ALSO requirements from OUTSIDE the team - users/stakeholders - yes!  
Need business knowledge to do it! What's the user trying to do?  
Big up for not only checkboxing what someone told us  
We need to align with other activities in team - yes!
Mention of business skills and systems thinking! nice.  
You can never achieve 100% coverage yes  
Testing is one type of risk mitigation!! yes  
Any test plan can only be a template because of context! yes  
The earlier you find the error, the cheaper it is to fix. Important point (:  
Appreciate the idea about using common language for all testers, but sometimes pedantic re: failure or defect?  

### Why testing necessary
Testing shouldn't be restricted to only testers!! Any stakeholder can.  
yes to coaching devs on test techniques, in agile we're coaches for devs - yes  
big agree that QA and test are NOT the same  
Actually interesting re: root cause analysis is a QA activity (aka whole team process)  
Useful justification one-liners on why to test at X stage  

### Activities, Wares, and Tools
Impact of context (:  
Not sold on the importance of standards and document templates, though worth checking them
Dont agree that only test management can decide approach/strategy  
Also dont like the formality of procedure, suite, and execution schedule  
Good that Pair testing is mentioned  
Not sure about test logging - aka not only defects but that we did it at all (maybe important for some businesses and industries)  
Too much focus for my liking on 'managment defines this' and testers just execute it, old fashioned  

### Essential skills and good practices 
Active listening and curiousity yes of course  
Mention of Empathy and Collaboration! Yay  
Mention of Whole Team Approach in ISTQB! :D 

### Test Types
Good overview but very high level, appropriate for foundation  

### Techniques
Measure coverage - nonsense information - this is part of ISTQB I find not helpful  
State Diagrams and Decision Table are intuitive :D
But 'how many test cases to achieve X coverage' -> for whom is this helpful?
Recommended Explore it! Plus points! (minus points for mentioning JB)

### Early Feedback & Review Involvement
This part is so important and relevant and useful! :D 
Maybe not the (subjective, I dont work in those industries) formal parts  
But course also talked about informal coffee point reviews lol and other realistic scenarios

Mentioned Lisa with Agile Quadrants! :D 
Actually agile topics got introduced v4?? tool support got removed instead

### However, Exam 
Is it just that I hate exams?  
Or is it silly money-making to trip people up on purpose and have unnecessary glossaries??
