### Notes
- Write about what you read (forces understanding)
- In your own words (own thinking, novel insight)

### Note Titles
- Write it after the note content (emergent)
- Positive Framing (systematic connections)
- API design (SRP but dont go too far)
- Complete phrases (concept orientated)
- Questions also good (with goal to drop the question mark)

### Interconnectedness
- Tags are ineffective
- Prefer explicit to inferred association
- Prefer labelled association. eg. X goes into more detail about Y in context Z (instead of X relates to Y)
- Manual. Process of thinking about relationships is how do own thinking!

### Process
- Broad > Finergrain > Connect > Revise
- Speculative Outlines (to avoid blank page paralysis)
- No dates (irrelevant)
